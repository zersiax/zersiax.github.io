# Welcome
If you've come this far, you've made it through the first session. And you're still hungry for more.
First, awesome job for sticking with it. I absolutely respect how difficult and overwhelming all this can be if you've never been exposed to any of this. From the get go you're just supposed to understand this boatload of terms, concepts and ideas and at times, you may not even know where to begin asking questions.
Some of you may even feel like this isn't for you, like others seem to know way more than you do and therefore you must be terrible at this whole coding thing.

Let me tell you  secret. Many seasoned, well-read,  university-educated senior developers feel that exact same way from time to time. The coding world moves fast, and what was cool last week may be ancient today. So we all try to keep up with the rat race, all the while hoping that nobody notices how out of our depth we all are at times.
That fear of being found out actually has a name, [impostor syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome). 
Take a look at the title of this website. It starts with "don't panic", which is something I shamelessly nicked from Douglas Adams's [The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy). It's very apt for a course like this, though.
Here's a couple statements I'd like you to try to keep in mind while going through these sessions with us. Some ofthem may seem obvious to some, in which case have a cookie for being observant. nevertheless, I'd like to make a few things clear:

* We're here to learn, not to already know. Asking questions is a great way to do that, making mistakes is an even better way to do that. Put the two together and you have an awesome learning strategy going.
* No such thing as a stupid question. We were all new to all this once, and if you have enough of an urge to ask a question, it's probably a good question. Go for it :)
* You can't break it. All the topics we will cover will be completely safe to experiment around with in your own time. Taking an example and modifying, extending or horribly mutilating it is a fantastic way to get the basics down, and I highly encourage you to do that with any topic you feel the urge to do so about.
* I welcome ant and all feedback. I'm here to learn just as much as you are, albeit in a different way. On the other hand, I already know what I am teaching, and am therefore here to help you all get the most of this course. Some of you have already offered me some great suggestions, one of which actually was the impetus for me writing this website. :)

## On Asking questions

There is a great many of you, which is fantastic, but it may also mean I may not get to your question right away.
The Slido, linked in the menu above, is a good way to ask your question, as I'll see it when I do, and you won't have to depend on being picked during class.
If, for some reason, the Slido does not work for you, or you're having trouble using it, there's a Contact page in the menu at top that has other ways to reach out to me directly. These are intended as a fallback, though, so pretty please don't spam me to smithereens. :)

For me to best be of help to you, it's a good idea to follow the checklist below before you reach out. This will ensure you learn the most from the encounter, and it will best equip me to give you an answer you can actually benefit from.

* What were you trying to do?
*  What did you expect to happen?
* What happened instead?
* Have you googled the question?

If, in your question, you cover these four points, two things might happen. Either you formulating the problem on paper leads you to the solution, something we refer to as [rubber duck debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging), or you've given me all the details I need to reproduce your problem and help you find a solution.
As for Googling the question, that's not me being lazy. Developers google an untold amount of things every single day, and getting good at doing this is a good skill on its own. It can often also get you an answer far quicker than I ever could, but particularly when starting out you may not have the background to understand the results you find.  In that sense, I'd still recommend doing it, but I'm not going to bite your hea off if you couldn't make heads or tails of the results you got back.
