# Discord

The course now has a Discord server where questions can be asked both to me, as well to each other.


Please note that this server will not be actively moderated. We're all adults, and I'm sure we can get along, so I'm not all that worried, but I will unfortunately just not have the time to actively make sure nothing terrible happens.
If something does happen, you can always send me a message explaining the situation, and we'll see what can be done.


Several channels have been created to cut down on the chatter for people who are looking for something specific. I do ask you all to stay on topic within these channels; the server is meant to exchange information and for people to use as a reference. If there's demand, I might create an OffTopic channel for guide dog stories and cat videos. :)


You can join the server using [the invite link](https://discord.gg/FhpAd7BaVG). Please note that for the best experience, you will want to make sure you create a Discord account and have the Discord app installed and logged in prior to clicking said link.

Unfortunately, at times, Discord uses a captcha service called HCaptcha, which is annoying to use but ultimately does work, if you finick with it enough. 


I unfortunately can't really help you if things go south, take it up with their customer service department or Ye Olde Google if you get stuck, as this service often either works or doesn't, in which case the only real thing to do is try again or yell at them, both of which I'm sure you are more than capable to do yourselves. :)
