# Session 3 Notes

These notes will actually be pretty short, as most of what we covered in class was in the context of a single file, the live.py file from session 1's homework.


I have prepared a thoroughly commented version of the same file that will explain most of what we covered textually. This file can be found [here. Heh, I do like teasing you folks with inaccessible link texts](https://www.dropbox.com/s/afkkj2z02qx0gz9/live_with_comments.py?dl=0). All joking aside, this is obviously not an ideal link text but is so annoyingly common that it's good to get used to them.

## Other Notes

These are mostly nuggets of useful info that came out of questions and discussions during class.

- How does one get help on a module or function in Python? Use the help() function in the REPL, giving it the function or module name as an argument. Make sure you import it first if it's an imported function, or you'll get a nameError.
- What to do with screenshots during a training or course? You can try your screen reader's OCR function (NVDA+r, JAWS+space o, ctrl+shift+cmd+w for VOCR if you have it on the mac).
- What to do with elements that don't say if they're checkboxes, buttons etc? Try to click them anyway, both with enter/space as well as your screen reader's mouse emulation keys. You may not see if a checkbox is checked, but this works surprisingly often.
- What to do if the course requires significant amounts of drag-and-drop? Drag the course over a deep hole, then drop it. There's often no way to make these interactions accessible unless specifically made to be accessible, something COMPTIA has recently done for their online certificate exams for example. 

## On Mainstream Video Courses

This was not really asked in classs, but I'll add it as a freebie as we see these more and more often.


Particularly if you are a screen reader user, you will be at a disadvantage when using video courses. You are not the intended demographic, people don't know you exist and once a video's been created, it's very difficult to make it any more accessible than it is at the point of filming.
Having said that though, video courses can absolutely be used provided a few circumstances come together properly, namely:


- You have access to the assets. If code is shown in the video, there's some way for you to look at that code, on for example a GitHub repository, attachments to the video, transcripts etc.
- You already have a bit of experience. It saves you tons of Googling if you already know the very basics of what you're looking at. 
- You have a teacher that narrates properly. Not too much "If I do this, now that happens and if you look here my belief everyone has working eyes is validated". This can be a bit of a needle in a haystack to find, but they are out there. Even so, this narration will at times skip bits of punctuation, which is why the previous point is very apt.


## Homework

Next week will almost entirely be a primer on HTML, so if you want to do a bit of preparation, that is the thing to look into. For the rest, go play with the code sample, ask all the questions. They are welcome on the Slido, the Discord and other such fun places. See you all next week :)
